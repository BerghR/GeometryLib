# GeometryLib

## A C# Geometry Library

This is a brand new project and a such not much information is available at this time.

## Sort term goals

1. ~~Two lines intersection point (actual or projected )~~ Completed.
2. Multiple lines intersections (actual only)
3. Polygon detection from multiple lines
4. Point in Polygon detection
5. Sortes path from intersection point to another intersection point by (Vertices or Length)
6. Polygon Triangulation
~~7. Point on line check~~ Completed
8. Add a Tolerance functionality
